	"content-policies-card-1-title": "Neutral point of view",
	"content-policies-card-1-description": "All encyclopedic content on Wikipedia must be written from a neutral point of view, which means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic.",
	"content-policies-card-2-title": "Verifiability",
	"content-policies-card-2-description": "In the English Wikipedia, verifiability means that people can check that facts or claims correspond to reliable sources. Its content is determined by published information rather than editors' beliefs, experiences, or previously unpublished ideas or information.",
	"content-policies-card-3-title": "No original research",
	"content-policies-card-3-description": "Wikipedia articles must not contain original research. On Wikipedia, original research means material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published source exists. This includes any analysis or synthesis of published material that reaches or implies a conclusion not stated by the sources.",
	"content-policies-card-4-title": "Assume good faith",
	"content-policies-card-4-description": "Assuming good faith means assuming that people are not deliberately trying to hurt Wikipedia, even when their actions are harmful. This is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia. Most people try to help the project, not hurt it. Otherwise, a project like Wikipedia would have been doomed from the beginning."
